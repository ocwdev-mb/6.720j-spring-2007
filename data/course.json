  "course_description": "6.720 examines the physics of microelectronic semiconductor devices for silicon integrated circuit applications. Topics covered include: semiconductor fundamentals, p-n junction, metal-oxide semiconductor structure, metal-semiconductor junction, MOS field-effect transistor, and bipolar junction transistor. The course emphasizes physical understanding of device operation through energy band diagrams and short-channel MOSFET device design. Issues in modern device scaling are also outlined. The course is worth 2 Engineering Design Points.\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nProf. Jes\u00fas del Alamo would like to thank Prof. Harry Tuller for his support of and help in teaching the course.\n",
